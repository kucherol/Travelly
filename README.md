Simple Portfolio Website - Travelly

Welcome to one of my first frontend project, a simple portfolio website built using HTML and CSS!

As a Vue.js developer, I ventured into the world of web development by crafting this static website to showcase my skills and creativity.
This project primarily features an elegant and responsive design, making it easily accessible across various devices and screen sizes. The layout is crafted with modern web design principles, including a clean user interface, intuitive navigation, and aesthetically pleasing elements.

Within this repository, you'll find well-organized HTML files that structure the content and layout, while the CSS stylesheets breathe life into the website with eye-catching visuals and engaging animations.

As I continue to grow and explore the world of web development, I cherish this project as a reminder of my progress and how far I've come. Feel free to explore the code, clone the repository, or even suggest improvementsâ€”I'm always open to feedback and eager to expand my skills.
